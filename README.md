# Climate-and-Sales-Correlation

### Objective and Approch <br/>
The analysis investigates how climate factors—temperature and precipitation—impact retail sales across Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, aiming to inform inventory, marketing, and staffing strategies.
I examined decade-long monthly data to identify correlations and actionable patterns. The approach combined statistical analysis with industry-level segmentation, supported by visual dashboards for clarity.

### Data Summary <br/>
Data sources included Statistics Canada retail trade tables  and Environment Canada climate records .<br/>
To establish a reliable basis for correlation analysis:<br/>
- Climate datasets were first consolidated and harmonized, ensuring consistency across all sources. <br/>
- Standardizing date formats eliminated temporal discrepancies, while organizing retail industries into 11 categories enabled meaningful segmentation for comparative insights. <br/>
- Monthly averages were calculated to smooth short-term fluctuations and highlight underlying trends. <br/>
- Null values were retained deliberately, as their negligible proportion was assessed to have no material impact on analytical validity, thereby preserving data integrity. <br/>
- Finally, datasets were integrated by province, year, and month, creating a structured and coherent framework that enhances reproducibility and supports robust statistical inference.
